#IMPORTANT NOTE: Since I was working on a previous version on iOS Mac as well as XCode,
I just uploaded the .m and .h files since it would not work on a current iOS mac.

QUESTION 9 :

In order to be able to create this Objective-C application working under Windows 10 64bits, it was necessary:

1.	Download and install VMware Workstation 14 Pro 
2.	Install respecting the default options
3.	Download and install
a.	MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6 for VMware
b.	Patch Tools <win-install.cmd> necessary to unlocked MacOS protection
4.	Make sure MacOS is running well on Virtual Machine
5.	From MacOS find on Internet and install XCode 9.4.2
6.	In order to make MacOS full screen, it is necessary…
    a.	 download ‘VMwareTool.iso’ and set this image as an external drive
    b.	Install and follow the instructions under MacOS (as normal application)
    c.	When done, you should be able to change the display settings and make the screen resolution to fit your monitor (1920x1080)

To accomplish all of these tasks:
Installing XCode MacOS under Windows 10 64bits      real time = 14 hours

QUESTION 8 :

For the Calculating Grade letter I used a simple nested if-else:

NOTE: My original intention was to use Switch but it seems that float number are not allowed,
so I decided for nested if-else:

    -(NSString *)calculateFinalGrade {
        float total = (midTermExam + project + finalExam) / 3;
        if (total >= 90) {
            return @"A";
        } else if (total >= 80) {
            return @"B";
        } else if (total >= 70) {
            return @"C";
        } else if (total >= 60) {
            return @"D";
        }
        return @"F";
    }

First, I calculate the average of the 3 grades (all of them with same weight) and then
if any of the condition is met, it just ends the function with Return so that it never gets to the final of the
entire function. This function returns a String (A, B, C, D or F).
